<div class="field field-name-field-body"><p id="english"><strong>Dear Website Visitors</strong>,<br/>
We thank you for visiting our website at <a href="http://geometrics.jacobs-university.de/">http://geometrics.jacobs-university.de/</a>. 
To ensure that you feel safe and comfortable when browsing our website, we would like to inform you about how we handle your personal data. 
This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information, including personal information, in conjunction with 
your access to and use of our website.<br /><br /><strong>Data</strong> <strong>Controller</strong><br/>
When this policy mentions "we," "us," or "our," it refers to Jacobs University Bremen gGmbH, Campus Ring 1, 28759 Bremen, Germany,

><strong>Storing of IP Addresses</strong><br />Protecting your privacy is very important to us. We use information that we 
receive and store during your visit to our website exclusively for internal purposes and to improve the design of the website, including sub-pages. 
If necessary for the purpose of defending against attacks that impair the functionality of our website (hacker attacks, malware, denial of service 
attacks, spam), we may access your computer's IP address for this purpose alone, which is stored by our telecommunications provider as a security 
measure for a period of seven days. After this period has elapsed, we will either delete or anonymize the IP address. The legal basis for this 
processing is Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR.<br /><br /><strong>Usage Information</strong><br />When you visit our website, we temporarily store usage 
information on our web server for statistical purposes in the form of a log in order to improve the quality of our website. This data record consists 
of:<br /><li>The page from which the file was requested</li><br /><li>The name of the file</li><br /><li>The date and time the file was accessed</li>
<br /><li>The quantity of data transferred</li><br /><li>The status of access (file transfered, file not found)</li><br/><li>A description of the type of 
web browser used to access the file</li><br/><li>The IP address of the computer accessing the file, shortened by the last three digits</li><br />
We use this information to enable access to our website, to control and administer our systems, and to improve the design of our website. 
The data stored is stored in anonymized form. This means it is not possible to create personal user profiles based on this information. 
Data about individuals or their individual behavior is not collected.<br /><br /><strong>Data Transfers to Third Parties</strong><br />
We do not transfer your personal data to third parties without your express consent.<br /><br />

<strong>Your Rights as a Website User</strong><br />When it comes to processing your personal data, the GDPR grants you certain 
rights as a website user:<br />1. Right of Access (Art. 15 of the GDPR):<br />You have the right to request confirmation as to whether 
personal data concerning you is being processed; where this is the case, you have a right of access to this personal data and to the 
information specified in Article 15 of the GDPR.<br />2. Right to Rectification and Right to Erasure (Art. 16 and 17 of the GDPR):<br />
You have the right to immediately request the rectification of incorrect personal data concerning you and, if necessary, the completion 
of incomplete personal data.<br />You also have the right to request that personal data concerning you be erased immediately if one of
the reasons listed in Art. 17 of the GDPR applies in detail, e.g. if the data is no longer required for the purposes for which it was 
collected.<br />3. Right to Restriction of Processing (Art. 18 of the GDPR):<br />You have the right to request a restriction of
processing for the duration of a review if any of the conditions specified in Art. 18 of the GDPR have been met, e.g. if you have 
lodged an objection to the processing.<br />4. Right to Data Portability (Art. 20 of the GDPR):<br />In certain cases (which are 
outlined in detail in Article 20 of the GDPR), you have the right to obtain from us your personal data in a structured, standard,
machine-readable format or to request the transfer of such data to a third party.  <br />5. Right to Object (Art. 21 of the GDPR):
<br />If data is collected on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (data processing on the grounds of legitimate interests), 
you have the right to object to the processing at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation. If you make such 
an objection, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing 
which override your interests, rights, and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.<br />6. Right to
Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory AuthorityIn accordance with Art. 77 of the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a 
supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of your personal data violates data protection regulations. This right to 
lodge a complaint may particularly be exercised before a supervisory authority in the EU member state where you reside, work, 
or where you suspect that your rights have been infringed.<br /><br /><strong>Data Protection Officer</strong>Our data protection 
officer will be happy to provide you with information or suggestions on the topic of data protection:<br />Dr. Uwe Schl√§ger<br />
