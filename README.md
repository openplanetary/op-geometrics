# op-metrics

## Why ? what?

The motivation behind  this repo is the following: 

* measure openness of planetary data and create/evaluate metrics of data usage in scientific (and non-scientific) publications, with relevant alt-metrics for the largest possible amount of planetary missions/experiments
* measure metrics/impact of planetary experiment data vs. public availability (e.g. a top-cited paper is using data that only a certain team has access to vs. data from certain teams/experiment are used by X and Y, with metrics)

## How? How can I contribute?
With anything you can. We would like to publish this in the end on a peer-reviewed scientific publication, so usable/citable. Things that would be needed now are:

* evaluation of data sources for data/publication metrics
* access to data (PDS, PSA, ADS, Google Scholar and alike)
* use/development of scripts/tools for harvesting dat afrom the sources above, also with free text (certain experiments are quoted with an experiment paper, certain - perhaps - with data-related DOI, certain others just as text in the introduction, methodology or acknowledgements. Moreover, processing level and/or special products provided privately by individuals or teams would need some text processing not just grep or alike..)
* advice/supoprt/help on data access and analysis related to the above

## Public?
At the moment, in the early phases, this is private, but as soon (ehm.. "if") we have something put together, the idea would be to make it public and eventually make it a paper, edited collaboratively and submitted/reviewed here via issues (or in ways tbd).

## Who is behind this?

Angelo and Nicolas  discussed this a couple of times in one way or another. This is a starting effort to focus into a self-contained effort, with a publication of data/code/paper in mind as an outcome (and some future measure/monitoring of impact).
